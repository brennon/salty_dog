  ##
  # PBKDF2 encapsulates the identically-named password-based key derivation
  # function outlined in PKCS[http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127] #5: Password-Based Cryptography Standard. PBKDF1, as set 
  # forth in the same document, has been recommended for removal from use, and
  # thus is not implemented in SaltyDog. If you just need to generate keys,
  # skip down to ::digest:

  class PBKDF2

    ##
    # According to the recommendation, the hash functions that are supported
    # for HMAC (pseudorandom number generation) are SHA1, SHA224, SHA256,
    # SHA384, AND SHA512. These are provided here.

    ALLOWED_DIGESTS = [:sha1, :sha224, :sha256, :sha384, :sha512]
    
    ##
    # The primary point of entry for SaltyDog::PBKDF2. The available options
    # are:
    #
    # - :digest - One of +:sha1+, +:sha224+, +:sha256+, +:sha384+, or
    # +:sha512+. Defaults to +:sha512+.
    # - :password - A password for use in deriving the key. Required, and must be a string.
    # - :salt - A salt that is concatenated to the password in key derivation.
    # Required, and must ba a string.
    # - :length - The desired length, in bytes, of the derived key. Required.
    # - :iterations - The number of iterations to be used in key derivation.
    # Defaults to 10000.
    #
    # Returns a hex-string representing the derived key.
